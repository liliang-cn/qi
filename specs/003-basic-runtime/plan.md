# Implementation Plan: Basic Runtime and Synchronous I/O

**Branch**: `003-basic-runtime` | **Date**: 2025-10-22 | **Spec**: `/specs/003-basic-runtime/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-basic-runtime/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is generated by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The 003-basic-runtime feature implements a foundational runtime environment for Qi programs with synchronous I/O operations, memory management, and comprehensive Chinese language support. Based on research findings, this feature will be implemented in Rust 1.75+ with hybrid memory management (ownership + reference counting), cross-platform support, and TDD methodology. The runtime provides core execution environment, file system operations, network I/O, standard library functions, and Chinese error messaging. This serves as a pre-dependency for the subsequent async runtime (002-async-runtime-tdd) feature.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+ with tokio runtime + custom coroutine scheduler + okio 1.0+, LLVM 15.0+
**Primary Dependencies**: crossbeam, libc, tokio, serde, anyhow, thiserror, proptest, criterion
**Storage**: File-based storage with UTF-8 encoding support, in-memory data structures
**Testing**: cargo test with proptest for property-based testing, criterion for benchmarking
**Target Platform**: Linux, Windows, macOS (cross-platform with platform-specific optimizations)
**Project Type**: single (runtime library with CLI interface)
**Performance Goals**: <2s startup time, <5% memory growth, 95%+ I/O success rate, >95% test coverage
**Constraints**: <100ms memory allocation overhead, <1s program termination cleanup, full UTF-8/Unicode support
**Scale/Scope**: Single runtime instance supporting multiple concurrent Qi programs, memory-efficient for long-running processes

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure chosen for the basic runtime library. The runtime is organized into logical modules (core runtime, memory, I/O, stdlib, error handling) with clear separation of concerns. FFI layer provides platform abstraction, CLI interface offers program execution, and comprehensive testing structure ensures quality.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitutional violations identified. The design follows established patterns and maintains appropriate complexity for the requirements.

| Design Decision | Rationale | Simpler Alternative Rejected |
|----------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Hybrid Memory Management (Rust + Reference Counting) | Handles complex object relationships while maintaining performance | Pure ownership system insufficient for circular references in object graphs |
| C FFI Layer for Platform Abstraction | Provides necessary platform-specific optimizations while maintaining unified API | Pure Rust implementation would limit access to certain OS-specific features |
| Comprehensive Error System with Chinese Localization | Critical requirement for Chinese language support with proper debugging context | English-only errors would not meet core Chinese language requirements |

The implementation will provide a solid foundation for Qi program execution with synchronous I/O, memory management, and Chinese language support. The modular architecture and clear separation of concerns will facilitate subsequent integration with the async runtime feature (002-async-runtime-tdd).
