# Feature Specification: Async Runtime and Coroutine Support

**Feature Branch**: `002-async-runtime-tdd`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "逐步开始做runtime， 支持异步和协程 TDD！"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Async Operations (Priority: P1)

Qi developers need to write asynchronous programs using Chinese async keywords (异步, 等待) to perform non-blocking operations like file I/O, network requests, and timer operations. They expect their programs to handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently without blocking the main thread.

**Why this priority**: This is the core foundation for async programming in Qi, enabling non-blocking operations that are essential for modern applications dealing with I/O operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by writing simple async programs that perform file reads or network operations concurrently and verify they complete faster than synchronous versions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Qi source file with async function declarations using Chinese keywords, **When** compiled and executed, **Then** the program runs without syntax errors and executes asynchronously
2. **Given** multiple async operations running concurrently, **When** executed, **Then** operations complete in parallel rather than sequentially
3. **Given** an async function that returns a result, **When** awaited using Chinese await keyword, **Then** the result is correctly received and used

---

### User Story 2 - Coroutine Creation and Management (Priority: P1)

Developers need to create, manage, and coordinate coroutines using Chinese keywords (协程, 创建, 挂起, 恢复) to implement cooperative multitasking within their programs. They expect coroutines to be lightweight and have explicit control over execution flow.

**Why this priority**: Coroutines provide fine-grained control over concurrent execution and are essential for building complex asynchronous patterns and state machines.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating coroutines that pass control between each other and verify correct execution order and state preservation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** coroutine creation statements using Chinese syntax, **When** executed, **Then** coroutines are created and can be managed independently
2. **Given** coroutines that voluntarily yield control, **When** executed, **Then** control transfers correctly between coroutines
3. **Given** suspended coroutines, **When** resumed, **Then** they continue execution from their suspension point with preserved state

---

### User Story 3 - Error Handling in Async Context (Priority: P2)

Developers need robust error handling for async operations and coroutines, with the ability to catch and handle exceptions that occur in asynchronous contexts. They expect error handling to work seamlessly with the async/await pattern.

**Why this priority**: Proper error handling is crucial for reliable async programs, as errors can occur at any point in the asynchronous execution flow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally causing errors in async operations and verifying they are properly caught and handled without crashing the program.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** async operations that may fail, **When** errors occur, **Then** errors are properly caught and handled with clear Chinese error messages
2. **Given** coroutines that encounter exceptions, **When** errors happen, **Then** exceptions propagate correctly to the appropriate error handlers
3. **Given** nested async calls, **When** errors occur in nested contexts, **Then** error handling works correctly through the call chain

---

### User Story 4 - Async I/O Operations (Priority: P2)

Developers need to perform asynchronous file and network I/O operations using Qi's async features, allowing their programs to handle multiple I/O operations concurrently without blocking. They expect standard I/O operations to have async equivalents.

**Why this priority**: I/O operations are the most common use case for async programming, and providing async I/O is essential for practical applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by writing programs that perform multiple file operations or network requests concurrently and measure performance improvements over synchronous versions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** async file read/write operations, **When** executed, **Then** multiple file operations can proceed concurrently
2. **Given** async network operations, **When** executed, **Then** network requests don't block other program execution
3. **Given** mixed I/O operations, **When** executed, **Then** the program efficiently handles concurrent file and network operations

### Edge Cases

- What happens when coroutines attempt to access shared resources simultaneously?
- How does the system handle memory allocation failures during async operation creation?
- What happens when an async operation is awaited multiple times?
- How are circular dependencies between async operations detected and handled?
- What happens when the system runs out of available coroutine slots?
- How are time-sensitive async operations handled under high load?
- How does the system handle fallback to synchronous operations when async runtime is unavailable?
- What happens when basic runtime foundation is missing or incomplete?
- How are mixed sync/async I/O operations handled in the same program?
