# Tasks: Qi Language Compiler Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-qi-language-compiler/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the feature specification, so test tasks are not included. The focus is on getting a working compiler first.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Each user story represents a complete, independently testable increment of functionality.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/`, `runtime/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow the single project structure from plan.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with previous stories but should be independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with any stories but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Models before services (where applicable)
- Services before endpoints (where applicable)
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- Model-related tasks within stories can often run in parallel
- Platform-specific code generation can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Stories 1-2

```bash
# Work on User Story 1:
Task: "Implement lexical analysis for Chinese keywords in src/lexer/mod.rs"
Task: "Create Chinese keyword token recognition in src/lexer/keywords.rs"
Task: "Implement parsing for basic expressions in src/parser/grammar.rs"

# Work on User Story 2 (in parallel):
Task: "Extend type system with all basic types in src/semantic/types.rs"
Task: "Add type checking for variable declarations in src/semantic/type_checker.rs"
Task: "Create Chinese error messages for type conflicts in src/utils/diagnostics.rs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Compilation)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Basic Compilation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Data Types)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Control Flow)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Functions)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
