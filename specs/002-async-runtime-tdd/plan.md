# Implementation Plan: Async Runtime and Coroutine Support

**Branch**: `002-async-runtime-tdd` | **Date**: 2025-10-22 | **Spec**: [Async Runtime and Coroutine Support](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-async-runtime-tdd/spec.md`

## Summary

The Qi Language Compiler needs async runtime and coroutine support to enable non-blocking concurrent programming with Chinese language keywords (异步, 等待, 协程, 创建, 挂起, 恢复). This requires implementing an async runtime system with coroutines, event loop, async I/O, and integration with the existing compiler infrastructure while maintaining performance targets of <1ms coroutine overhead and support for 10,000 concurrent operations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+ with tokio runtime + custom coroutine scheduler
**Primary Dependencies**: tokio 1.0+, LLVM 15.0+, existing Qi compiler infrastructure
**Storage**: In-memory task queues, coroutine stack pools, async state management
**Testing**: cargo test with tokio-test, async-std test framework, TDD methodology
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux/macOS/Windows/WebAssembly) with platform-specific optimizations
**Project Type**: single - extending existing Qi compiler with async runtime components
**Performance Goals**: <1ms coroutine creation, <100μs task switching, 50% faster I/O, 10,000+ concurrent operations
**Constraints**: Linear memory scaling, Chinese keyword integration (异步, 等待, 协程, 创建, 挂起, 恢复), TDD required
**Scale/Scope**: Runtime supporting 50,000+ concurrent operations, LLVM coroutine intrinsics integration

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Project Constitution Analysis

Based on standard software development principles, this project must adhere to core principles:

**I. Library-First Architecture**:
- ✅ Async runtime designed as standalone library with clear integration points
- ✅ Self-contained components (scheduler, coroutines, I/O handlers)
- ✅ Clear purpose: enabling async programming in Qi language

**II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- ✅ TDD approach explicitly requested by user ("TDD！")
- ✅ Comprehensive test strategy planned (unit, integration, performance)
- ✅ Tests must be written before implementation as per requirement

**III. Integration Testing**:
- ✅ End-to-end async program compilation and execution testing
- ✅ Runtime integration with existing Qi compiler components

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ PASSED - No constitutional violations identified

### Post-Design Constitution Re-check

**I. Library-First Architecture**: ✅ CONFIRMED
- Async runtime designed as modular library with clear integration points

- Comprehensive test strategies defined for all async components
- Performance benchmarks established for validation

**III. Integration Testing**: ✅ CONFIRMED

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure extending existing Qi compiler with dedicated async_runtime module. The async functionality is integrated into existing compiler phases (lexer, parser, semantic, codegen) while maintaining a cohesive runtime library for cross-platform support.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitutional violations identified. The async runtime extension follows the existing compiler architecture patterns and maintains library-first design principles.

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Foundation (async runtime core, basic coroutine support)
2. **Phase 2**: Core Features (async I/O, Chinese keyword integration)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (network operations, performance optimization)
4. **Phase 4**: Polish (cross-platform compatibility, documentation, tooling)

The design provides a solid foundation for implementing async/await and coroutine support in the Qi programming language with clear technical decisions, detailed architecture, and comprehensive planning documentation.
