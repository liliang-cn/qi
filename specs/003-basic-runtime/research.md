# Basic Runtime and Synchronous I/O Research Document

**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: Basic Runtime and Synchronous I/O for Qi Language
**Research Focus**: Technical architecture and implementation decisions for TDD-based runtime development

## Executive Summary

This research establishes the technical foundation for implementing Qi's basic runtime environment with synchronous I/O operations. The findings confirm Rust 1.75+ as the optimal implementation language with hybrid memory management (ownership + reference counting) and TDD development methodology with small incremental implementation steps.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Implementation Language: Rust 1.75+

**Decision**: Implement core runtime in Rust 1.75+ with strategic C FFI bridges

**Rationale**:
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model prevents common runtime bugs (dangling pointers, data races)
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and compile-time optimizations
- **Ecosystem**: Mature crates for runtime development (tokio, crossbeam, libc)
- **LLVM Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Qi compiler backend

**C Integration Points**:
- System call abstraction layer (libc, winapi equivalents)
- Platform-specific optimizations where Rust cannot directly access OS features
- Legacy library interoperability when needed

### 2. Memory Management: Hybrid Rust Ownership + Reference Counting

**Decision**: Combine Rust's ownership system with reference counting for circular references

**Architecture Components**:
- **Ownership System**: Handles most memory allocations and deallocations automatically
- **Reference Counting**: Manages complex object relationships and cycles
- **Memory Pooling**: Pre-allocated pools for frequently created objects (strings, buffers)
- **Garbage Collection**: Mark-and-sweep algorithm integrated with ownership model

**Performance Targets**:
- **Allocation Overhead**: <50ns for small objects, <1Î¼s for large allocations
- **Memory Growth**: <5% during extended program execution
- **Cleanup Time**: <100ms for complete resource cleanup on program termination

### 3. Standard Library Implementation: Rust + C Hybrid

**Decision**: Core functions in Rust, system calls via C FFI

**Architecture Strategy**:
- **Rust Core**: High-performance algorithms and data structures (strings, collections, math)
- **C FFI Layer**: Platform-agnostic system call abstraction
- **Optimization**: Inline hot paths, FFI only for complex system interactions

**Performance Benefits**:
- **String Operations**: Rust's optimized string handling with proper Unicode support
- **Mathematical Functions**: Compile-time optimization of numeric operations
- **System Calls**: Direct OS-level calls without indirection penalties

### 4. Development Methodology: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Decision**: Strict TDD with small incremental implementation steps

**TDD Implementation Strategy**:
- **Red Phase**: Write failing tests for each runtime component
- **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- **Refactor Phase**: Optimize and clean code while maintaining test coverage
- **Incremental Steps**: Each feature developed in small, independently testable units

**Testing Framework**:
- **Unit Tests**: `cargo test` with `proptest` for property-based testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end program execution with various workloads
- **Performance Tests**: `criterion` for benchmarking runtime components
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Validation across Linux, Windows, and macOS

## Performance Analysis and Target Validation

### Startup Performance

**Target**: <2 seconds program startup time

**Achievability Analysis**:
- **Rust Startup**: Typical Rust programs startup in 10-100ms range
- **Runtime Initialization**: <500ms for all runtime components

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Lazy loading of non-essential runtime components
- Pre-allocated memory pools for common operations
- Compile-time string literal optimization
- Efficient symbol table initialization

### Memory Management Performance

**Target**: <5% memory growth over extended execution

**Analysis**:
- **Ownership Model**: Rust's compile-time ownership checks eliminate most memory leaks

## Cross-Platform Implementation Strategy

### Platform-Specific Optimizations

**Linux**:
- `epoll`-based event notification for async operations
