# Tasks: Qi Language Compiler Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-qi-language-compiler/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (‚úÖ), spec.md (‚úÖ), research.md (‚úÖ), data-model.md (‚úÖ), contracts/ (‚úÖ)
**Generated**: 2025-10-19

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is a compiler that requires comprehensive validation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Compiler project**: `src/`, `tests/`, `runtime/` at repository root
- Paths follow the established project structure from plan.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Multi-Platform & Optimization (Phases 8-9)**: Can run in parallel after core stories
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May use variables from US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May use types from US2
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after other stories - Enhances error reporting for all

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Lexer/Parser before Semantic Analysis
- Semantic Analysis before Code Generation
- Core implementation before examples and documentation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Multi-platform support tasks can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Hello World test fixture in tests/fixtures/basic/hello_world.qi"
Task: "Create simple calculation test in tests/fixtures/basic/calculator.qi"
Task: "Lexer unit tests for Chinese keywords in tests/unit/lexer_tests.rs"
Task: "Parser unit tests for basic expressions in tests/unit/parser_tests.rs"
Task: "End-to-end compilation test in tests/integration/end_to_end.rs"

# Launch all foundational lexer tasks together:
Task: "Create Token definitions and types in src/lexer/tokens.rs"
Task: "Implement Chinese keyword lookup table in src/lexer/keywords.rs"
Task: "Add Unicode character handling in src/lexer/unicode.rs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with Hello World
5. Deploy/demo basic compiler functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Basic compiler (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Type-safe variables
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Control flow structures
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Functions and calls
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Better error messages
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Basic compilation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Types and variables)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Control flow)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Later phases can be divided similarly

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Performance goals: <5s compile time, <20% C performance gap, <100MB memory usage
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
