# Feature Specification: Qi Language Compiler Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-qi-language-compiler`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "001-qi-language-implementation)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Program Compilation (Priority: P1)

Chinese-speaking developers want to write simple programs using 100% Chinese keywords and compile them to executable binaries. They need to be able to write basic programs like "Hello World" and simple calculations, compile them without errors, and run the resulting executables successfully.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality that demonstrates the language works end-to-end. Without basic compilation, no other features are possible.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by compiling a simple Hello World program and verifying it produces the expected output when run.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Qi source file with basic Chinese syntax, **When** the compiler is invoked, **Then** it produces an executable file without errors
2. **Given** the compiled executable, **When** run from command line, **Then** it outputs the expected Chinese text message
3. **Given** a Qi source file with calculation operations, **When** compiled and executed, **Then** it produces the correct numerical results

### User Story 2 - Data Type and Variable Handling (Priority: P1)

Developers need to declare variables using Chinese type names (整数, 字符串, 布尔), assign values to them, and perform basic operations. They expect type safety and clear error messages when type rules are violated.

**Why this priority**: Variables and data types are fundamental to any programming language and enable more complex program logic.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by compiling programs with various variable declarations, assignments, and operations to verify correct behavior and error handling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** variable declarations with Chinese type names, **When** compiled, **Then** the program runs without runtime type errors
2. **Given** type mismatch operations, **When** compiled, **Then** clear error messages are displayed indicating the type conflict
3. **Given** string manipulation operations, **When** executed, **Then** string operations produce correct results

---

### User Story 3 - Control Flow Structures (Priority: P2)

Developers need to use Chinese control flow keywords (如果, 否则, 当, 对于) to create programs with conditional logic and loops. They expect these structures to behave consistently with standard programming languages.

**Why this priority**: Control flow enables complex program logic and is essential for real-world applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by compiling programs with various control flow structures and verifying they execute correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** if-else conditional statements using Chinese keywords, **When** executed with different conditions, **Then** the correct branches are taken
2. **Given** while loop constructs, **When** executed, **Then** the loop iterates the correct number of times
3. **Given** for loop constructs with ranges, **When** executed, **Then** all elements in the range are processed

---

### User Story 4 - Function Definition and Calling (Priority: P2)

Developers need to define functions using Chinese keywords (函数, 返回), pass parameters, and call functions from other parts of their program. They expect proper parameter passing and return value handling.

**Why this priority**: Functions enable code reuse and modular programming practices.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by defining functions with various parameter types and return values, then calling them and verifying results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** function definitions with Chinese syntax, **When** compiled, **Then** functions can be called successfully
2. **Given** function calls with parameters, **When** executed, **Then** parameters are passed correctly and return values are received
3. **Given** recursive function calls, **When** executed, **Then** recursion works without stack overflow (for reasonable depths)

---

### User Story 5 - Error Messages and Debugging Support (Priority: P3)

Developers need clear, helpful error messages in Chinese when compilation fails or runtime errors occur. They expect error messages to indicate the exact location and nature of problems.

**Why this priority**: Good error handling is essential for developer productivity and learning.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally introducing various types of errors and verifying the quality of error messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** syntax errors in source code, **When** compilation is attempted, **Then** clear error messages with line numbers are displayed
2. **Given** runtime errors during execution, **When** errors occur, **Then** helpful error messages are shown
3. **Given** missing dependencies or configuration issues, **When** compilation fails, **Then** actionable guidance is provided

### Edge Cases

- What happens when developers mix Chinese keywords with English identifiers?
- How does the system handle very large source files or complex expressions?
- How are Unicode characters and encoding issues handled in source files?
- What happens when memory allocation fails during compilation?
- How are circular dependencies in modules detected and reported?
