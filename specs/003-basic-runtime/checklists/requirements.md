# Specification Quality Checklist: Basic Runtime and Synchronous I/O

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [Basic Runtime and Synchronous I/O](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All checklist items PASSED** - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase

### Quality Assessment Summary

**Content Quality**: ✅ Excellent
- Specification focuses entirely on user needs and business value
- Written in clear, accessible language for non-technical stakeholders
- No implementation details or technology-specific requirements
- All mandatory sections (User Stories, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ Excellent
- No clarification markers remain - all requirements are clear and specific
- All functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Comprehensive edge cases identified (7 key scenarios)
- Clear scope boundaries established
- Dependencies and assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ Excellent
- All 12 functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- 5 comprehensive user stories covering primary runtime flows
- 8 measurable success criteria with specific targets
- Clean separation of user requirements from implementation concerns

### Key Strengths

1. **Foundational Focus**: Clear focus on providing the basic runtime foundation that async features will build upon
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Complete runtime lifecycle from program execution to resource cleanup
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Consistent performance across Linux, Windows, and macOS
4. **Chinese Language Integration**: Proper UTF-8 support and Chinese error messaging throughout
5. **Practical I/O Operations**: Real-world file and network operations that developers need

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase for technical planning and architecture design.

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
