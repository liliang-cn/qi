# Feature Specification: Basic Runtime and Synchronous I/O

**Feature Branch**: `003-basic-runtime`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "003-basic-runtime"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Program Execution (Priority: P1)

Qi developers need a basic runtime environment that can execute compiled Qi programs with proper memory management, error handling, and system resource management. They expect programs to run reliably with predictable performance and clear error messages when issues occur.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational runtime capability required for all Qi programs to execute. Without a basic runtime, no compiled programs can run, making this the most critical dependency for the entire language ecosystem.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by compiling and running a simple Qi program (Hello World) and verifying it executes properly with correct output and resource cleanup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a compiled Qi executable, **When** executed from command line, **Then** the program runs to completion without runtime errors
2. **Given** a Qi program with memory allocations, **When** executed, **Then** all memory is properly allocated and freed without leaks
3. **Given** a Qi program that encounters an error, **When** the error occurs, **Then** a clear Chinese error message is displayed and the program exits gracefully

### User Story 2 - Synchronous File I/O Operations (Priority: P1)

Qi developers need to perform synchronous file operations (read, write, create, delete) using Chinese file I/O keywords and functions. They expect files to be handled efficiently with proper error handling and support for different file formats including UTF-8 text files.

**Why this priority**: File I/O is fundamental for most practical programs. This provides the synchronous I/O foundation that async operations will build upon, ensuring basic file operations work before adding complexity of asynchronous patterns.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating Qi programs that perform various file operations (reading text files, writing data, creating directories) and verifying the operations complete successfully and files contain expected content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Qi program with file read operations using Chinese keywords, **When** executed, **Then** file contents are read correctly and displayed as expected
2. **Given** a Qi program that writes data to files, **When** executed, **Then** files are created with correct content and proper UTF-8 encoding
3. **Given** a Qi program attempting to access a non-existent file, **When** the error occurs, **Then** a clear Chinese error message is displayed without program crash

---

### User Story 3 - Synchronous Network Operations (Priority: P2)

Qi developers need to perform basic synchronous network operations (HTTP requests, TCP connections) to interact with web services and APIs. They expect network operations to work reliably with proper timeout handling and error reporting in Chinese.

**Why this priority**: Network connectivity is essential for modern applications. Providing synchronous network operations establishes the foundation that async network operations will extend, ensuring basic network functionality works reliably.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating Qi programs that make HTTP requests to public APIs and verify responses are received correctly, or by creating simple TCP client/server applications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Qi program making HTTP requests, **When** the request is sent, **Then** responses are received and parsed correctly
2. **Given** a Qi program with network timeout settings, **When** a network operation exceeds timeout, **Then** the program handles the timeout gracefully with clear error messaging
3. **Given** a Qi program connecting to unavailable network services, **When** connection fails, **Then** appropriate error handling occurs without hanging

---

### User Story 4 - Memory and Resource Management (Priority: P1)

Qi developers need automatic memory management and resource cleanup to write safe programs without manual memory management. They expect the runtime to handle garbage collection, reference counting, and proper cleanup of system resources like file handles and network connections.

**Why this priority**: Memory and resource management is critical for program stability and security. Poor memory management leads to crashes, security vulnerabilities, and resource exhaustion, making this a foundational requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating Qi programs with complex memory usage patterns and monitoring memory consumption, resource cleanup, and program stability over extended execution periods.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Qi program with frequent memory allocations and deallocations, **When** executed for extended periods, **Then** memory usage remains stable without leaks
2. **Given** a Qi program opening many files and network connections, **When** the program completes, **Then** all resources are properly cleaned up
3. **Given** a Qi program approaching memory limits, **When** allocation fails, **Then** graceful error handling occurs with clear Chinese error messages

---

### User Story 5 - Standard Library Functions (Priority: P2)

Qi developers need access to standard library functions for common operations like string manipulation, mathematical operations, date/time handling, and system information access. They expect these functions to work consistently with Chinese language support and proper error handling.

**Why this priority**: Standard library functions provide the building blocks for most applications. Having a robust standard library ensures developers can build practical programs without reinventing common functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating Qi programs that use various standard library functions and verify they work correctly with Chinese text, mathematical calculations, and system operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Qi program using string manipulation functions, **When** processing Chinese text, **Then** all string operations work correctly with proper Unicode handling
2. **Given** a Qi program performing mathematical calculations, **When** executed, **Then** all calculations produce accurate results within expected precision
3. **Given** a Qi program accessing system information, **When** system calls are made, **Then** information is retrieved correctly and displayed appropriately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the runtime runs out of memory during program execution?
- How does the system handle file permission errors or locked files?
- What happens when network operations are interrupted by system signals?
- How are circular references in data structures handled during garbage collection?
- What happens when programs attempt to access unavailable system resources?
- How does the runtime handle extremely large files that may not fit in memory?
- What happens when standard library functions receive invalid parameters or out-of-range values?
