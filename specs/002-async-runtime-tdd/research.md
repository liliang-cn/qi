# Async Runtime Research Document

**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: Async Runtime and Coroutine Support for Qi Language
**Research Focus**: Technical architecture and implementation decisions

## Executive Summary

This research establishes the technical foundation for implementing async/await and coroutine support in the Qi programming language. After comprehensive analysis of multiple architectural approaches, we recommend a **Tokio + Custom Coroutine Scheduler** hybrid architecture implemented in Rust with FFI bridges to the existing C runtime.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Runtime Language Choice: Rust-based Implementation

**Decision**: Implement async runtime primarily in Rust with strategic C integration points.

**Rationale**:
- **Seamless Integration**: Native compatibility with existing Qi compiler (Rust-based)
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and compile-time optimizations
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model prevents common concurrency bugs
- **Ecosystem**: Access to mature async ecosystem (tokio, async-std, etc.)
- **Maintenance**: Type safety reduces runtime errors in complex async code

**C Integration Points**:
- Runtime library interface for cross-platform compatibility
- Low-level system calls (epoll, kqueue, IOCP)
- Memory management and garbage collection integration

### 2. Async Runtime Library: Tokio + Custom Scheduler

**Decision**: Use Tokio as foundation with custom coroutine scheduler for Qi-specific optimizations.

**Architecture Components**:
- **Tokio Core**: Event loop, I/O drivers, timer wheel
- **Custom Scheduler**: Work-stealing scheduler optimized for Chinese language semantics
- **Coroutine Pool**: Pre-allocated coroutine stacks for <1ms creation overhead
- **Task Queue**: Priority queues for async operations with Chinese keyword integration

**Performance Analysis**:
| Metric | Requirement | Tokio Capability | Custom Enhancement |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Coroutine Creation | <1ms | 50-100ns | Stack pooling + optimization |
| Task Switching | <100μs | 10-50μs | Chinese language aware scheduling |
| Concurrent Operations | 10,000+ | 100,000+ | Memory-efficient coroutines |
| I/O Performance | 50% faster than sync | 2-10x faster | Zero-copy optimizations |

### 3. LLVM Integration Strategy

**Decision**: LLVM coroutine intrinsics with custom code generation for async operations.

**Integration Points**:
- **Coroutines**: LLVM `coro.save`, `coro.suspend`, `coro.resume` intrinsics
- **Async Functions**: Custom lowering to LLVM coroutine ABI
- **Await Expressions**: Continuation passing style code generation
- **Stack Management**: Split coroutine stacks with lazy allocation

**Chinese Language Integration**:
- Keywords: 异步 (async), 等待 (await), 协程 (coroutine), 创建 (create), 挂起 (suspend), 恢复 (resume)
- Compile-time optimizations for Chinese async patterns
- Error messages in Chinese with proper async context

## Cross-Platform Implementation

### Platform-Specific Optimizations

**Linux/macOS**:
- Event notification: epoll (Linux), kqueue (macOS)
- Thread model: pthreads with affinity binding
- Memory management: jemalloc/tcmalloc integration

**Windows**:
- Event notification: IOCP (I/O Completion Ports)
- Thread model: Win32 Threads with thread pool
- Memory management: Windows Heap API

**WebAssembly**:
- Event model: Promise/async + Web Workers
- Threading: SharedArrayBuffer + Atomics
- Limitations: No direct system calls, sandboxed execution

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Memory Management

**Coroutine Stack Pooling**:
- Pre-allocated coroutine stacks (64KB default)
- Segmented stacks for memory efficiency
- Pool management with automatic growth/shrink

**Task Scheduling**:
- Work-stealing scheduler with per-CPU queues
- Priority scheduling based on Chinese async patterns
- Load balancing across executor threads

### I/O Optimization

**Zero-Copy Operations**:
- Direct buffer management for file I/O
- Scatter-gather I/O for network operations
- Memory-mapped file operations

**Async I/O Primitives**:
- File operations: `read_async`, `write_async`, `seek_async`
- Network operations: `connect_async`, `accept_async`, `send_async`, `recv_async`
- Timer operations: `sleep_async`, `timeout_async`
